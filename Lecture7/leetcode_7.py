Topics: premium lock icon
Hint
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Example 1:
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"

Example 2:
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
 

Constraints:
The given address is a valid IPv4 address.

def defangIPaddr(address: str) -> str:
    address = address.replace(".", "[.]")
    return address

#print(defangIPaddr("1.1.1.1"))
#print(defangIPaddr("255.100.50.0"))
