Hint
Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= n
Follow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?
You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

Hint
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
